            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I’m a storyteller. Whether it’s through an anecdote of my childhood in El Salvador, a fictional short story, a press release or the design of a brand identity, I like to tell a tale. I’m easily excitable and tend to babble, but I am passionate, creative and resourceful. I’m an editor, a writer, a communicator, and a budding designer; I love learning new things, reading good books and drinking good tea.</p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>I have worked at The Florida Bar in Tallahassee for eight years. Through various positions at two different departments, I have honed a wide range of skills – from basic phone etiquette and press release crafting to management of multi-page websites and creation of statewide educational campaigns.</p>
